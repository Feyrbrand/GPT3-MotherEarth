A GPT3 Project to communicate with Mother Earth and ask her some questions

Enter an instruction or select a preset, and watch the API respond with a completion that attempts to match the context or pattern you provided.

You can control which model completes your request by changing the model.

## Add your API key

Copy one of your API keys generated in your GPT3 Account and add it into the ```api_key.py``` file.
